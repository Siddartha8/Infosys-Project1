🤖 Customer Review Insight AI
📝 Project Overview
Customer Review Insight AI is an Infosys internship project that uses Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze customer feedback at a fine-grained, aspect level.
It goes beyond basic sentiment scoring, delivering exactly which product/service features are loved or criticized—enabling actionable improvements and strategic business insights.​

🎯 Objectives
Classify reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral, both overall and by aspect.​

Automatically extract frequent aspects, topics, and keywords from customer feedback.​

Visualize satisfaction trends, aspect rankings, and sentiment flows for business clarity.​

Provide a scalable, accurate, and AI-powered review insight platform suitable for any industry.​

🧠 Features
🧹 Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, normalization.​

🏷️ Aspect Extraction: Identifies features using rule-based and NLP methods (battery, service, delivery, etc.).​

🔍 Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis: Positive/negative/neutral scoring for each aspect.​

🚦 General Sentiment Analysis: Summarized sentiment for each review.​

📊 Visualization: Dashboards showing aspect distributions, trends, and keyword clouds.​

🛡️ Authentication & Security: JWT-secured registration/login, profile and report management.​

📈 Performance Metrics: Accuracy, confusion matrix, user analytics.​

🌐 (Optional) Flask web app for interactive analyses and reporting.​

👨‍💼 Admin Dashboard: Category management, system monitoring, and advanced analytics.​
